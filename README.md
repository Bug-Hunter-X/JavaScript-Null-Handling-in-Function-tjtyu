# JavaScript Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to null value handling within a function. The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers, but its approach to handling null inputs may lead to unexpected behavior or mask other errors.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function directly returns 0 when either input is null. While this handles the null cases, it might silently fail to detect other potential errors.  More sophisticated null checks and error handling might be necessary in a production setting to ensure better robustness and error reporting.

## Bug Solution

The solution demonstrates more robust null checks and error handling.
